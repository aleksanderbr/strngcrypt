Hello there! 

This app started as a sideproject for me to learn about 
cryptography and javascript. At some point I realized that 
sites like cryptii.com (from wich I adapted parts of the 
initial design) don't really offer a playfull interaction 
-> encryption -> learning experience. The users have to 
decipher the meaning of all the settings and buttons by 
themselves before they can get a meaningful encryption of 
their message. By providing a visualization of key mappings,
interactive displays of middle steps, short explanatory 
helper texts and references to further reading material, I 
believe the overall experience to be more pleasant then with
the average black-box encryption app.
This project is meant to be a fun introduction into the field
of cryptography for myself and potential users.
