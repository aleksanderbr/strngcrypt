Hello! 

This app is a sideproject to learn about cryptography and 
javascript. I realized that sites like cryptii.com don't really 
offer a playfull interaction -> encryption -> learning experience. 
The users have to decipher the meaning of all the settings and 
buttons by themselves before they can get a meaningful encryption 
of their message. By providing a visualization of key mappings,
interactive displays of middle steps, short explanatory 
helper texts, frequency analysis, index of coincidence and 
reference to further reading material, I believe the overall 
experience to be more pleasant. 

This project is meant to be a fun introduction into the field
of cryptography for myself and potential users.
